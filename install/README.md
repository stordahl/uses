My install script

# Getting Started

1. Download ZIP to new machine, un-zip and move the script into the root of your machine.
2. Give `install.sh` executable permissions
```shell
cd install && chmod +x install.sh
```
3. Check where bash is installed and update the script with the right path
```shell
which bash # #!/bin/bash
```
4. Run that thang!
```shell
./install.sh
```
